# Where we're at
We are a short way into the project. Productivity has been slow due to deprication.
## Skeletal KINNECTion
 - Joints shown on screen
 - Lines drawn between joints to create a "skeleton"
## Unity Example
 - Seperate Unity example shows a 3D model functioning properly
 - Skeleton Model can move in the Unity Project

# Where we got stuck
Overall we had issues with outdated/depricated technology. With the realese of the Kinnect v2 for the XBox One, there is no longer support for the Kinnect v1 we were using. 
## Skeletal KINNECTion
 - Correct version of XNA could not be installed; 3D modeling could not be added (hence the Unity Example)
## Unity Example
 - Skeleton Model Remains in T-pose in the Unity Project
 - The realization to use Unity came too late, so we couldn't develop this side too much

# Where we would continue
 - Create our own Unity project 
 - Port all Skeletal KINNECTion progress to Unity

# How to run
 - You need a lot of old things that are tough to find.
 - For both you need Kinnect SDK v1.8 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278
## Skeletal KINNECTion
 - Connect Your Kinnect with a USB adapter
 - Open and run KinectGestureFeature.sln in Visual Studio
## Unity Example
Note: this requires Unity 4, not the most recent 2019.x
 - Connect Your Kinnect with a USB adapter
 - Open and run "Unity Example\Assets\AvatarsDemo\KinectAvatarsDemo.unity" in Unity 4
